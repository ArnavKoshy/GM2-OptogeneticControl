# An overview of the project

## The problem

In many developing countries, the gaps in terms of research and equipment is significant. One example is the accessibility to reagents for enzyme is very limited, and this cause troubles in their research and development. One effective solution is to use optogenetic device to boost the production of bacteria. This will help scientists in the Global South greatly, so they no longer limit the creativity, ambition and impacts. In this project, our group coorperate with Jenny Molloy to improve the optogenetic device.

## The solution - optogenetics

Multiple optogenetics designs has already been built. However, one main problem with these designs is a lack of experimental data and quantitative analysis to help achieve more accurate monitor the optogenetics control. To solve this problem, we built a testing rig that measures the light intensity circumferentially to collect experimental data. We also came up with a numerical model, which is implemented in python and effectively simulate the light transmission behaviour through the cylinderial container.
