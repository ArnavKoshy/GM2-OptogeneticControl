# The project and Sustainable Development Goals

The project's impact can be assessed by considering how closely it aligns with the following UN [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.globalgoals.org/goals/)

## Reduced inequalities
---
Enzymes are a crucial component when it comes to essential chemical processes such as water purification, or disease treatment and detection.
The components act as catalysts in chemical reactions, and are needed in the Global South.

The problem however, is that enzyme imports are very scarce, expensive and the delivery time is high. 
Furthermore, the local synthesis of enzymes requires reagents, which are also hard and expensive to deliver to poor countries.

Enzymes are needed in the Global South, but can't be acquired sustainably to satisfy the needs.

One solution that may be able to improve that problem is using Optogenetics.
The principle is the following: by directing light at bacteria, there is a production of enzyme. This is of course wavelength and intensity dependant, but this solution is fairly simple to implement and promising.

This allows better access to enzymes in the Global South, reducing access inequalities to products necessary for research towards other development goals.

## Resilient infrastructure - distributed production of enzymes
---
Optogenetics is conducted in a structure that is called a bioreactor. The bioreactor is container ranging in volume from 500mL to a few dozens of litres.
Once the bioreactor is acquired, and the lighting rig is setup, all there is to do is to put bacteria in the reactor and start the optogenetics process. 

Bacteria are easily accessible even in Global South countries, which enables them to have a resiliant enzyme supply chain. Moving the production of enzymes to the place of use is beneficial in improving the resilience of supply chains to disruption and shortage, as well as reducing acquisition times.

In terms of setup, the solution we came up with only uses an Arduino card, which can be run by any basic laptop, and LEDs which are easily found anywhere in the world. One step further from our project would be to design specifications that can take into account most LED specs and adapt the solution accordingly.



## Sustainable economic growth
---
Optogenetics allow countries in the Global South to not rely on enzyme or reagents import, and to produce enzymes locally. This allows independent economic growth of research sectors of these countries, without depending on foreign imports. 

Furthermore, the vast majority of the components needed to run our setup can be sourced locally.

An Arduino card, LED strips, 3D printed parts and any laptop are components that can be obtained very quickly and easily.

This makes the enzyme production local and virtually independant from any imports.

## Partnership towards the goals.
---

Enabling production of necessary enzymes in developing countries facilitates them to independently work towards other UN Sustainable Development Goals without relying on foreign supplies. 
This, coupled with the reduced acquisition time for necessary enzymes, dramatically accelerates the pace of research and progress in developing countries.
