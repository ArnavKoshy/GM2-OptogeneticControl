# The project and Sustainable Development Goals


## Reduced inequalities
---
Enzymes are a crucial component when it comes to essential chemical processes such as water purification, or disease treatment and detection.
The components act as catalysts in chemical reactions, and are needed in the Global South.

The problem however, is that enzyme imports are very scarce, expensive and the delivery time is high. 
Furthermore, the local synthesis of enzymes requires reagents, which are also hard and expensive to deliver to poor countries.

Enzymes are needed in the Global South, but can't be acquired sustainably to satisfy the needs.

One solution that may be able to improve that problem is using Optogenetics.
The principle is the following: by directing light at bacteria, there is a production of enzyme. This is of course wavelength and intensity dependant, but this solution is fairly simple to implement and promising.


## Resilient infrastructure - distributed production of enzymes
---
Optogenetics is conducted in a structure that is called a bioreactor. The bioreactor is container ranging in volume from 500mL to a few dozens of litres.
Once the bioreactor is acquired, and the lighting rig is setup, all there is to do is to put bacteria in the reactor and start the optogenetics process. 

Bacteria are easily accessible even in Global South countries, which enables to have a resiliant enzyme supply chain.

In terms of setup, the solution we came up with only uses an Arduino card, which can be run by any basic laptop, and LEDs which are easily found anywhere in the world. One step further from our project would be to design specifications that can take into account most LED specs and adapt the solution accordingly.

## Sustainable economic growth - less reliant on imports
---
Optogenetics allow Global South to not rely on enzyme or reagents import, and to produce enzymes locally.

Furthermore, the vast majority of the components needed to run our setup can be sourced locally.
Bacteria can be found in any local labs in the world.
An Arduino card, LED strips, 3D printed parts and any laptop are components that can be obtained very quickly and easily.

This makes the enzyme production local and virtually independant from any imports.

## Most importantly, allowing others to work towards SDGs
---
By enabling the production of enzymes to be higher and of better quality in underdeveloped areas, many problems are solved.
Issues such as disease detection or water treatment can be resolved, and ensure a much better standard of living for inhabitants in these areas.

In return, this promotes growth in general, whether it is health-wise or economy-wise.
Creating a more stable platform for development enables Global South countries to have a more solid base, which will enable them to focus on Sustainable Development on the long term.

Therefore, the optogenetics solution should be able to allow Third-World countries to work towards SDGs in the medium-term future.
