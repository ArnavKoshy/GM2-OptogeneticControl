##### I think it's a good idea for everyone to put the links of handover notes they wrote/contributed here...

Arnav:
- [Modelling Handover](/Modelling/DiffuseSim/README.md)
- [Data Collection Handover](/Testing%20Rig/DataCollection/README.md)
- [Circuit Design and Simulation Notes](/Testing%20Rig/PhotodiodeAmplification/Design%20and%20Simulations//README.md)
