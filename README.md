# GM2-OptogeneticControl
A repository holding information and resources about the GM2 project about optogenetic control in bioreactors for enzyme synthesis

For information about the project, what we've done and how it relates to UN Sustainable Development Goals, see [About](About/)

For information about the testing rig used to collect light intensity data around a bioreactor, see [Testing Rig](Testing%20Rig/)

For information about our light distribution model, see [Modelling](Modelling/)

For information about the final lighting rig design to light a bioreactor, see [Lighting Rig](Lighting%20Rig/)

For Alexandre: A list of handover documentation we've each individually contributed to is available in [Individual handover notes](Individual Handover Notes.md)
