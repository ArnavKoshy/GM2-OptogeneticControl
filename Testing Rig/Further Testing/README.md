Additional testing Rig Documentation

Description

This folder contains the files which will allow for more extensive testing of light intensity within the bioreactor, as our measurements were only made outside of the bioreactor, which issues with internal reflection for instance.

In order to test internally the intensity of the light without contaminating the bacterial environment, we designed a lid that enabled us to insert a test tube with a light sensor in it.
This lid clips on a pre-existing jar that Jenny and her team use in their experiments. 

The constraints design-wise are:
  It has to fit on the lid base
  A test tube has to be able to fit in the middle of it.
  
  
With theses constraints in mind, we started to design the testing lid.
